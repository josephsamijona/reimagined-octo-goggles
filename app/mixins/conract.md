INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR INTERPRETER AGREEMENT

This Independent Contractor Interpreter Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into by and between JHBridge Translation Services (“Company”) and the undersigned interpreter (“Interpreter”).

⸻

1. Independent Contractor Relationship

Interpreter is engaged as an independent contractor and not as an employee of the Company. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to create an employer-employee relationship, partnership, or joint venture. Interpreter is responsible for all federal, state, and local taxes, insurance, licenses, and expenses related to services provided.

⸻

2. Scope of Services

Interpreter agrees to provide professional interpretation and/or translation services as requested by the Company, including but not limited to on-site and remote assignments for courts, hospitals, legal offices, government agencies, and private institutions.

Interpreter shall perform all services in a professional, ethical, and timely manner and in accordance with applicable laws and professional standards.

⸻

3. Compensation

Interpreter shall be compensated according to rates agreed upon per assignment or schedule. Compensation is issued only for completed assignments and approved no-show compensation as outlined in this Agreement.

Interpreter acknowledges that payment timelines may vary depending on client payment cycles.

⸻

4. Scheduling, Cancellations, and No-Shows

Interpreters are required to arrive on-site at least fifteen (15) minutes prior to the scheduled start time of any assignment unless otherwise instructed.

If an appointment is canceled by the client or results in a no-show after the Interpreter has arrived on-site and remained on-site, the Interpreter must report the no-show to the Company or its designated dispatcher no earlier than fifteen (15) minutes after the scheduled appointment start time.

Failure to report a no-show in accordance with this policy, or failure to be physically present on-site at the scheduled appointment location, shall result in the appointment being considered canceled, and no no-show compensation shall be owed.

When properly reported and confirmed, the Interpreter shall be compensated for one (1) hour of work only, unless otherwise approved in advance by the Company or its designated dispatcher.

Payment beyond one (1) hour for a no-show or late cancellation may be authorized only at the discretion of the Company, based on factors such as distance traveled, prior notice, or specific client agreements.

Repeated no-shows or late cancellations may result in reduced assignment opportunities or removal from the Company’s active interpreter roster.

⸻

5. Attendance, Punctuality, and Reliability

Interpreters are expected to maintain professional reliability, including punctual arrival and adherence to confirmed assignments.

Late cancellations, defined as cancellations made less than forty-eight (48) hours prior to the scheduled appointment without Company approval, and tardiness, defined as failure to arrive on-site at least fifteen (15) minutes before the scheduled start time, are considered performance issues.

The Company reserves the right to take progressive corrective action, including but not limited to:
	•	Verbal or written warnings
	•	Reduced assignment priority
	•	Temporary suspension from assignments
	•	Removal from the Company’s active interpreter roster

The determination of corrective action shall be at the sole discretion of the Company and may be based on frequency, impact on clients, and prior performance history.

This obligation survives termination of this Agreement.
